## Koa Regiment

Koa Regiment is a small rewrite of [Regiment for Express](https://github.com/HustleInc/regiment/) for Koa and ES6 compatibility. It works by abusing the NodeJS cluster module in order to seamlessly replace workers after certain
criteria is met. The goal is to keep the cluster up without dropping requests.

#### Installation
```sh
npm install --save koa-regiment
```

#### Usage w/ Koa 2
```js
const Koa = require('koa');
const regiment = require('koa-regiment');

const app = new Koa();

// You can use either or both of the provided criteria middlewares, or contribute your own
app.use(regiment.middleware.MemoryFootprint(750)); // Replace workers after rss reaches 750mb
app.use(regiment.middleware.RequestCount(1000));   // Replace workers after every 1000 requests

regiment((id) => app.listen());          // default options
regiment((id) => { return app.listen(); }, options); // with options
```

##### Options

```js
{
  workers: 1,  // Number of workers you want -- default is number of CPUs
  deadline: 5000, // Milliseconds to wait for worker to gracefully die before forcing death -- default is 15000
}
```

#### Why would you want this?

 - You have a leak in production and want your application to stay up while you figure out what is going on or wait for a dependency to fix their leak.

 - You are familiar with `max-old-space-size` and other V8 knobs that crash your application when the threshold is met instead of gracefully responding to outstanding requests.

#### How does it work?

Workers use middleware to monitor for certain conditions like RSS size or requests served. When the criteria for replacement is met, a worker signals that it needs to be replaced by sending a message to the cluster.

The cluster receives the message and spins up a new worker. The cluster listens for the new worker and sends a signal to the old worker which instructs it to not accept any new connections and to exit after servicing all current requests. The old worker is then disconnected from the cluster and receives no new requests.

 - Note: You can have up to 2x `workers` when replacements come online but before the old ones gracefully die. This is temporary and *by design* as it drops back down to `workers`.

 - Note: By default, the number of workers is set to the number of available CPUs. This module works just as well on small servers where the number of CPUs is 1. A new worker is spawned and the old one is replaced. Cluster will wait this amount of time for the worker to die by itself and then forcefully kill it.
